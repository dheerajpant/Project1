# Project 1

This repository consists of a notebook containing code as per the requirement Project.

Title: 'Write A Data Science Blog Post'.

The dataset which i have chosen is from [Stack Overflow 2017 survey](https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017). Stackoverflow is famous and interesting. Further for more information you can refer to my blog also [Blog](https://dheerajpant.github.io/blog).

## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
This project uses a Jupyter Notebook running Python 3 with the libraries numpy, pandas and matplotlib. These can be installed using pip but should be included in the Anaconda distribution of Python.

## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>
This project was written as part of the Udacity Become a Data Scientist course. I used the Stack Overflow survey data due to my interest in professional software developers.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
Project1.ipynb contains the Python code for this project.
It assumes that the survey data is in the same directory.
This can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017 . 

## Results <a name="results"></a>
Throughout the notebook, I set out to answer four questions:
 
1. Which programming(coding) language is most popular in India?
2. What coding language does company wants from their employee(w.r.t India)
3. Which programming language has highest job satisfaction?
4. What is average salary of each programming langauge?

Finding:

* JavaScript, Java were the most used languages and preferred by most of the companies in India, therefore would be the most in demand and transferable skill between jobs. To support this, the most used frameworks are mostly JavaScript based. 

* Those who use less popular languages have higher job satisfaction but this may be a correlation between salary and job satisfaction.

* Languages that are known and used by less professionals warrant higher salaries.

## Acknowledgements <a name="acknowledgements"></a>
Must acknowledge Stack Overflow and Kaggle for the data, whose licensing can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017). 
Guidance on implementing the notebook and README were taken from learnings in the Udacoty course. The sole author of the code was Tom Barrett.
